# Not-A-Robot: CAPTCHA Design, Security & Attacks 🤖🔐

Created for ECE M117 - Introduction to Computer Security (Fall 2024) taught by Prof. Yuan Tian at UCLA.

## Project Overview

The **Not-A-Robot** project explores the design, security, and vulnerabilities of CAPTCHA systems, demonstrating their flaws, implementing potential attacks, and suggesting improvements. The aim is to raise awareness of common weaknesses in CAPTCHA designs, provide insight into methods of bypassing them, and propose more secure alternatives to improve user authentication and security systems across various platforms. 🛡️💻

## Purpose 🎯

CAPTCHAs are widely used across the web to protect websites from bots and automated abuse. However, many existing CAPTCHA designs have inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This project seeks to identify these weaknesses by implementing attacks against current CAPTCHA systems, analyzing their effectiveness, and recommending improvements for stronger, more secure CAPTCHA mechanisms.

3. **Financial Institutions** 💳: Ensuring that authentication processes are resistant to bot-driven fraud and unauthorized access.
4. **Online Voting Systems** 🗳️: Ensuring that CAPTCHA mechanisms in online voting are secure and prevent fraudulent voting attempts.

## Installation ⚙️

**Note:** This code is compatible with Node.js v16.

To switch to v16 (assuming it is already installed in your system), execute the following:

```nvm use 16```

To get started with this project locally, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asmik12/Not-A-Robot.git
cd Not-A-Robot
cd captcha-login-app
npm start
```

## Switching CAPTCHA Types ⚙️

Navigate to captcha-login-app -> src -> Login.js and comment/uncomment lines 15-17 as necessary.
E.g for Google's RECAPTCHA

```bash
navigate('/human-check');
```

E.g for our text-based CAPTCHA implementation
```bash
navigate('/captcha');
```
