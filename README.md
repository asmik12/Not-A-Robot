# Not-A-Robot: CAPTCHA Design, Security & Attacks 🤖🔐

## Project Overview

The **Not-A-Robot** project explores the design, security, and vulnerabilities of CAPTCHA systems, demonstrating their flaws, implementing potential attacks, and suggesting improvements. The aim is to raise awareness of common weaknesses in CAPTCHA designs, provide insight into methods of bypassing them, and propose more secure alternatives to improve user authentication and security systems across various platforms. 🛡️💻

## Purpose 🎯

CAPTCHAs are widely used across the web to protect websites from bots and automated abuse. However, many existing CAPTCHA designs have inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This project seeks to identify these weaknesses by implementing attacks against current CAPTCHA systems, analyzing their effectiveness, and recommending improvements for stronger, more secure CAPTCHA mechanisms.
